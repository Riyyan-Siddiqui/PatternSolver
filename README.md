## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **Solve Any Puzzle Size**  
  Solve NxP sliding puzzles using a **fast, non-optimal strategic algorithm** based on human techniques.

- üìä **Algorithm Visualizer**  
  Compare runtimes and memory usage of common search algorithms using 3x3 puzzles:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **A\* Search** (with and without closed list)
  - **Iterative Deepening A\*** (IDA\*)

- üß† **Edit & Experiment Freely**
  - Solve manually using drag and drop
  - Edit start and goal states
  - Shuffle or reset puzzle
  - Rotate or flip tiles
  - Resize puzzle board dynamically
  - Randomize size and tile state

- üñºÔ∏è **Custom Backgrounds**
  - Upload local or URL-based images
  - Flip background image horizontally/vertically
  - Toggle grid borders and tile numbers

- üì± **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
  - Fully mobile-friendly
  - Installable and offline-capable

## üß© Strategic Solving Algorithm

This project includes a strategic algorithm to efficiently solve large puzzles. It‚Äôs based on [WikiHow‚Äôs human method](https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-Slide-Puzzles), adapted for custom goal states and optimized for performance.

### üîß Rules & Strategy

```text
1. If the puzzle is non-square, solve rows or columns until the remaining puzzle is square.
2. Alternate solving rows and columns until a 2x2 remains (must include the blank tile).
3. Direction of solving:
   - Solve rows top-down and columns left-right.
   - If on the goal's blank tile row/column, reverse direction.
4. Once a tile is in its goal position, never move it again.
   - Each solved row/column reduces the problem space.
   - Keep blank inside the unsolved inner area.




# Setup
This project has no runtime dependencies.  Mocha and Webpack are included as dev dependencies for testing, minifying assets, and adding a local web server to auto-refresh assets during development 

Install the dev dependencies with:
```
npm install
```

You can run a development server locally that auto-refreshes assets with:
```
npm start
```

Output minified assets for production with:
```
npm run build
```
